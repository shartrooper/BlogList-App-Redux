Jest is actually configured by default to applications created with create-react-app.

In addition to Jest, we also need another testing library that will help us render components for testing purposes. 
The best option for this used to be the enzyme library developed by Airbnb. 
Unfortunately, Enzyme does not support React hooks properly, so we will instead use react-testing-library which has 
seen rapid growth in popularity in recent times.

Let's install the library with the command:
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

NB: the console may issue a warning if you have not installed Watchman. 
Watchman is an application developed by Facebook that watches for changes that are made to files. 
The program speeds up the execution of tests and at least starting from macOS Sierra, 
running tests in watch mode issues some warnings to the console, 
that can be gotten rid of by installing Watchman.

Instructions for installing Watchman on different operating systems can be found from 
the official Watchman website: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/
